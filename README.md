# Restaurant Index 

* Users can see a display of all restaurants that are clickable links to individual show pages.
* Restaurants display with key pertinent information.
* Packaging the individual restaurants into smaller components helped structure and compress code into bite sized pieces while overcoming the challenge of modifying nested components.

```javascript
class RestaurantIndexItem extends React.Component {
constructor(props) {
    super(props);
}


render() {
    const restaurant = this.props.restaurant
    return (
        <div className="restaurant-index-item">
            <Link to={`/restaurants/${restaurant.id}`} className="show-link-item" key={restaurant.id}>
                <div className='rest-unit'>
                    <div className='photo'>
                        <img src={restaurant.photoUrl} className="unit-photo" />
                        <div className='unit-info'>
                            <div className="name">{restaurant.name}</div>
                            <div className="city">{restaurant.city}</div>
                            <div className="price">{restaurant.price}</div>
                            <div className="cuisine">{restaurant.cuisine}</div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </Link>
        </div>
    )
}
}
```

# Restaurant Show

* Restaurants render as a sleek compartmentalized show page.
* In order to faciliate easy manipulation of SCSS and compact code, breaking down inherited image urls and restaurant information components allowed for more maneagable code structure and readable notation. 

```javascript
const RestaurantPhotos = ({allPhotos}) => {
    
   const photoDisplay = allPhotos.map((photoUrl) => {
       return  <li><img src={photoUrl} className="profile-images-show"/></li>
      
   )

    return (
        <div className='profile-photos'>
            <ul className='all-photos'>
                {photoDisplay}
            </ul>
        </div>
    )
    
     
}

export default RestaurantPhotos;

```
